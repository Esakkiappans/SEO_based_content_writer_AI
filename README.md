#Explanation
Data Fetching
The application fetches data from a given URL using the requests library. It then cleans the HTML content using Beautiful Soup to remove unwanted sections and extract the main content.

##Data Processing
The cleaned text is split into smaller chunks to create a vector store using Langchain's FAISS and CharacterTextSplitter. This vector store is used to find the most relevant information when answering user questions.

##Content Creation
When a user asks a question, the application uses the vector store to find the most relevant information and generates an answer using Hugging Face's transformer models. The answer is provided as SEO-friendly content, which can be used for blog posts, articles, or other web content.
